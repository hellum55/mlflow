# Identify credit card fraud with an ML classifier
This is the root directory for an example project for the
[MLflow Classification Recipe](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/recipes.html#classification-recipe).
Follow the instructions [here](../README.md) to set up your environment first,
then use this directory to create a classifier and evaluate its performance,
all out of box!

In this example, we demonstrate how to use MLflow Recipes
to identify fraudulent transactions give transaction time, amount, etc.
This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset collected and
analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning
Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big
data mining and fraud detection. More details on current and past projects
on related topics are available on http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/BruFence and
http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/ARTML.

In this [notebook](notebooks/jupyter.ipynb) ([the Databricks version](notebooks/databricks.py)),
we show how to build and evaluate a very simple classifier step by step,
following the best practices of machine learning engineering.
By the end of this example,
you will learn how to use MLflow Recipes to
- Ingest the raw source data.
- Splits the dataset into training/validation/test.
- Create a feature transformer and transform the dataset.
- Train a linear model (classifier) to identify fraudulent transactions.
- Evaluate the trained model, and improve it by iterating through the `transform` and `train` steps.
- Register the model for production inference.

All of these can be done with Jupyter notebook or on the Databricks environment.
Finally, challenge yourself to build a better model. Try the following:
- Find a better data source with more training data and more raw feature columns.
- Clean the dataset to make it less noisy.
- Find better feature transformations.
- Fine tune the hyperparameters of the model.
